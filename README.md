# Hello there!, It's me Jake

     I am 21, I love both Art and Tech 
it's a sight seeing those two as one. I spend most 
of my time investing on improving my skils exploring
web development and 3d graphics. 


    and I am glad to became part of 
avion school to boost my learning, confidence 
and communication skills.

    on the first part of learning. I learn a how
create github pages, It also sharpens my understanding 
on how version control works, improve my writing skills 
and most important thing taking a step forward.
